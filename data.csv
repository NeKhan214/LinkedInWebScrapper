You can share several shining examples of real work you've shipped, and what you learned along the way.You substantially contribute to defining the 'what' as well as the 'how'.You're a product manager's secret weapon.

UX Designer,"Introduction

Anatta is an ecommerce agency that helps digitally native brands be their best selves. In more than 10 years of operation we've been lucky enough to work with some incredible brands, including WeWork, Rothy's, Four Sigmatic, Berkey Filters, NutriBullet, Smartypants Vitamins, Kettle & Fire, Koss, Dr. Mark Hyman, Marie Forleo and scores more.

As we hope you'll discover over the next couple of minutes, we're a passionate bunch here at Anatta. We love the work we do, and we strive to wow our clients with everything we deliver.

In order to do that, we make sure we never stand still. We're always on top of the latest trends so that we can provide our clients with truly unrivaled services and solutions.

Ultimately, we try to improve as a business each and every day

And that's where you come in!

We're looking for a junior or entry level UX designer who has a design or technology background that is wanting to gain experience working with our user experience design team, specifically in the eCommerce field. You'll get to work daily with our developers, project managers, and clients to implement meaningful solutions with pixel-perfect designs.

Close collaboration is a big part of what makes us at Anatta different, so you'll be spending a lot of time working closely with our customers so it would be great if you thrive in client-facing situations. Among other things, you'll learn how to work alongside Anatta colleagues and shadow some of our senior designers and developers as they work with our customer stakeholders to design cohesive and creative user experiences, construct customer personas, and map out product / service lifecycles.

We'd Love to Talk to You if You Have

0-2 years of experience delivering interface design solutions for web or mobile applications A background/knowledge in graphic design or codingA demonstrated capacity and eagerness to learn and progress professionally in the

UX design field

Critical-thinking and problem-solving skills. *Be ready to show us some examples! Detail oriented and willing to learn Excellent communication skills

Our Culture

As we've already mentioned, we're rather passionate about our work here at Anatta. But we're also passionate about making work seem well, less like work. A big part of that comes from hiring the right people. We aren't looking for the first resum that checks off all the skills we need, but for a person who will feel as at home at Anatta as we do.

So, before you introduce yourself to us, we thought we'd introduce Anatta to you

We aren't corporate, and we never will be. There are just over 40 people working for Anatta, and we don't have plans to grow much beyond 60 in the future.

That's because we're about quality, not quantity, and we believe the surest way to be the best is to build a crack team of motivated, talented people doing work they love. We don't want to dilute that by hiring thousands of people, and we don't want to inherit the corporate culture that seems to infiltrate companies of a certain size.

We believe part of what makes Anatta awesome (if you'll pardon us for showing off for a moment), is that we combine many of the best bits of both big and small companies.

At Anatta, as in leading corporations, you'll be exposed to some of the best brands out there, working with some seriously cool products and tech on high-profile, high-impact projects. But just like a startup, you'll be able to get things done quickly, and you'll be given lots of responsibility and autonomy from day one: If we hire you, we trust you.

We're big believers in diversity, too. Of those 40+ employees we mentioned, we have people from Mexico, Ukraine, Singapore, Korea, England, Peru, and more. We also built Anatta to be deliberately flat, meaning everyone has access to everyone else including our CEO.

In fact (and it may be a little bit of a clich), we really do like to think of ourselves as one big family. If you give us your best, we'll give you ours in return. The success of Anatta rests on the people we employ, so we take great care to make sure they're happy, stimulated, and motivated. We also provide extensive training and certification sponsorship to make sure you're always moving in the right direction in your career.

You may have noticed a lot of our clients operate in the health / wellness space. That's because these industries are close to our hearts. There's no requirement to take up triathlon or pole vault in your spare time, but we're always running one wellness initiative or another, so an interest in healthy living is a bonus.

Lastly, let us say this: our culture isn't something we prescribe. We want to make sure you're going to love your time with Anatta, but this section you're reading right now is about more than that.

Sure, we want you to come on board and be a part of our culture. But we also want you to help shape it moving forwards. Just as we never stand still in our quest to remain at the cutting edge in ecommerce solutions, we're also constantly trying to make Anatta an even more magnificent place to work each day. If you have ideas about what makes a company culture special, Anatta is a place where you can turn those ideas into a reality.

What are the Benefits of working at Anatta?

With offices in Bangalore, Charleston and Los Angeles, we are a fun and diverse team of highly-driven individuals who experience and share deep joy for our work and the contributions we make in the world. When you work for Anatta, you get to be a part of that too!

On the slightly more tangible side, we also offer:

3% 401(k) contributionsUnlimited sick daysCompany-sponsored medical plansHealthy snack and drink options in office (mostly from Thrive Market)Cutting-edge technology (both hardware and software)Annual company retreatsRegular team events, group dinners, tripsA broad range of sponsored training programs for all roles

Next Steps

We wanted this job description to give you as much of an insight as possible into what it might be like to work for Anatta. If you think you're a good fit for the team and have the skills we're looking for, we're very much looking forward to hearing from you. Please apply below and we'll get to your application as soon as we can.
